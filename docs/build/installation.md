# Installation
Install a [Ceramic client](../learn/clients.md) to perform [writes](./writes.md) and [queries](./queries.md) on the network.

!!! warning "**MAINNET NOW LIVE!**"
    
    We're onboarding the first projects to [Mainnet](../learn/mainnet.md) from the waitlist. If you want to deploy to mainnet in the near future, **[sign up for the Mainnet waitlist](https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-mainnet-early-launch-program/)**. 

    While on the waitlist, you can always develop and prototype your integration on the [Clay Testnet](../learn/networks.md#mainnet). Demonstrating a fully-functioning integration that is ready for mainnet is a great way to increase your odds of being seleted from the waitlist. If you have questions or need further prioritization, you can [**join the Discord**](https://chat.ceramic.network) and let us know.


## **Install a client**
Ceramic is available in a variety of clients suited for different use cases. 

| Language | Client | Description | Details |
| ----- | ------ | ----- | --- |
| JavaScript | HTTP Client | Allows your project to interact with a remote Ceramic node over HTTP (*recommended*) | [Install](../learn/clients.md/#http-client) |
| JavaScript | Core Client | Allows your project to run the full Ceramic protocol (API and node) in any JS environment | [Install](../learn/clients.md/#core) |
| JavaScript | CLI | Allows developers to spin up a Ceramic node and/or interact with Ceramic from the command line | [Install](../learn/clients.md/#cli) |

> For optimal performance and data availability, it is recommended that you use the HTTP Client when building an application.
