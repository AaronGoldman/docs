# Writes
Writes are interactions that write to Ceramic such as creating new streams or updating existing streams.

All write operations are StreamType specific. The APIs for performing writes are contained within the various Stream implementations. See [StreamTypes](../../streamtypes/overview) for information on how to perform writes for each of the supported Stream types.

## Requirements
You need an [installed client](installation.md) and an [authenticated user](authentication.md) to perform writes.
