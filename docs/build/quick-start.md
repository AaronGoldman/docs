# Quick start
Learn the basics by setting up and interacting with the Ceramic CLI.

!!! note ""
    This tutorial serves as a simple introduction to Ceramic concepts and it intentionally simplifies things. See [installation]() to fully configure your client.

## Prerequisites

This quick start guide will use a terminal, **Node.js**, and **npm**. Make sure to have these installed on your machine.

## Install the CLI

Install the Ceramic CLI using your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
```

## Start the daemon

Start a Ceramic daemon on your local machine and automatically connect to it on port 7007, `http://localhost:7007`.

```bash
ceramic daemon
```

??? note "Network selection"
    The CLI starts a Ceramic node on the [`clay` testnet]() by default. If you would like to use a different Ceramic network, see the [installation]() guide.

More/other details about the configurations that come out of the box with the CLI.
