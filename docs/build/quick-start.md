# Quick start
Learn the basics by setting up and interacting with the Ceramic CLI.

!!! note ""
    This tutorial serves as a simple introduction to Ceramic concepts and it
    intentionally simplifies things. See [installation](./installation.md) to
    fully configure your client.

## Prerequisites

This quick start guide will use a terminal, **Node.js**, and **npm**. Make sure
to have these installed on your machine.

## Install the CLI

Install the Ceramic CLI using your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
```

## Start the daemon

Start a Ceramic daemon on your local machine and automatically connect to it on
port 7007, `http://localhost:7007`.

```bash
ceramic daemon
```

??? note "Network selection"
    The CLI starts a Ceramic node on the [`clay` testnet]() by default. If you
    would like to use a different Ceramic network, you can specify this with the
    `--network` option.

There are multiple options you can configure when you start the ceramic deamon.

See `ceramic daemon -h` for more information.


## Authentication
By default, the Ceramic CLI is authenticated with a
[Key DID](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519){:target="_blank"}. The seed
for this DID is stored in `~/.ceramic/config.json`. If this file is not present
on startup a new DID will be randomly generated. It's currently not possible to
use the Ceramic CLI with other DID methods.


## Create a document
To create a new document you can use the `create` command. In the example below
we create a document using the *tile* doctype.

```bash
$ ceramic create tile --content '{ "Title": "My first document" }'
DocID(kjzl6cwe1jw14a80400xpbj97sutzdssg9rklbyykj0zdxzbpmww4x9e9w4vcyr)
{
  "Title": "My first document"
}
```

The first line of the output is the *DocID*. This is the persistent identifier
of our newly created document. Below is the current content of the document.

??? note "More options"
    You can specify the *controller* and *schema* of the document by using the
    `--controllers` and `--schema` options respectively. Run `ceramic create -h`
    to see all available options.

## Query a document
In order to query a document you need to know its *DocID*. Given this we can
show its current content.

```bash
$ ceramic show kjzl6cwe1jw14a80400xpbj97sutzdssg9rklbyykj0zdxzbpmww4x9e9w4vcyr
{
  "Title": "My first document"
}
```

Perhaps more interestingly we can query the entire state of the document.

```bash
$ ceramic state kjzl6cwe1jw14a80400xpbj97sutzdssg9rklbyykj0zdxzbpmww4x9e9w4vcyr
{
  "doctype": "tile",
  "content": {
    "Title": "My first document"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "schema": null,
    "controllers": [
      "did:key:z6MkfZ6S4NVVTEuts8o5xFzRMR8eC6Y1bngoBQNnXiCvhH8H"
    ]
  },
  "signature": 2,
  "anchorStatus": "PENDING",
  "log": [
    {
      "cid": "bagcqceray2cbrwx45oa5nesee4s4cggkodmsttzuqfzh32yat3o26iw5m5rq",
      "type": 0
    }
  ],
  "anchorScheduledFor": "1/11/2021, 11:45:00 AM"
}
```

Here we can see various information about the document such as *content*,
*controllers*, and *schema*. We can also see the current *anchorStatus* of our
document. Above we see that our document has been scheduled to be anchored at
11:45 on the 11th of January 2021. Once this happens the state will be updated
with a new entry in the log and *anchorStatus* set to `ANCHORED`.

## Update a document
You can update documents which you are the controller of. In order to do this
you use the `change` command.

```jsx

```

??? note "More options"
    Currently you can change *content*, *controllers*, and *schema* using the
    cli. Run `ceramic change -h` for more information.


## Create a schema
In Ceramic you can enforce that documents follow a specific schema. The schemas
themselves are Ceramic documents where the content is a
[json-schema](https://json-schema.org/){:target="_blank"}. For example we can create a schema that
requires a document to have a *title* and a *message*.

```jsx

```

## Create a document that uses a schema
To create a document which uses the schema we just created above we simply use
the `--schema` option to pass the DocID at a specific commit of a schema. In
order to get the specific commitId we use the `ceramic commits` command.

```jsx

```

## Query the document you created
Now if we look at the state of the document we just created we can see that the
schema is set to the correct DocID.

```jsx

```

# That's it!
