# Community Nodes
This page contains a list of free, hosted Ceramic nodes made available by the community for the purposes of easily developing applications on Ceramic.

## Gateways
Gateways are nodes that provide read-only access to the Ceramic network. [3Box Labs](https://3boxlabs.com) provides free gateway nodes for use by the Ceramic community. Here is a list of their HTTP endpoints:

- Mainnet: `https://gateway.ceramic.network`
- Clay testnet: `https://gateway-clay.ceramic.network`


## Write/Read Nodes
Nodes provide full read and write access to the Ceramic network. 3Box Labs provides free write/read nodes for Ceramic developers. These nodes will run the latest release candidate of the Ceramic protocol.

    **Warning: These nodes will be periodically wiped so please don't rely on them for long-term persistence and availability of data**. If you need longer-term persistence of data on the Clay Testnet, consider [hosting your own node](../../run/nodes.md). Also note that streams created on the Clay Testnet will not be accessible on mainnet, so don't use this node for production deployments.
