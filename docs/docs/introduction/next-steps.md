### [**ComposeDB: Graph DB for Web3 Apps â†’**](https://composedb.js.org/)

ComposeDB is a decentralized graph database powered by Ceramic that enables you to build powerful Web3 applications using composable data, GraphQL, and reusable models. ComposeDB is the newest and most popular database built on Ceramic for building Web3 applications.

## **Run a Ceramic Node**
---

Run a Ceramic node to provide data storage, compute, and bandwidth for your Ceramic application. Today there are no tokenized incentives for running a Ceramic node, but by running a node you can ensure the data for your app remains available while helping contribute to the network's decentralization.
