# How to Contribute

Interested in contributing to Ceramic and the ecosystem? You've come to the right place! Here's a quick sumary of things we need help with and how you can get started. Even if what you want to do is not listed here, we probably accept contributions for it! If you're unsure, please open a issue.

## Code

---

Filecoin and its sister-projects are big, with lots of code written in multiple languages. We always need help writing and maintaining code, but it can be daunting to just jump in. We use the label Help Wanted on features or bugfixes that people can help out with. They are an excellent place for you to start contributing code.

The biggest and most active repositories we have today are:

- [ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic ↗]()
- [filecoin-project/lotus ↗]()
- [filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs ↗]()

If you want to start contributing to the core of Filecoin, those repositories are a great place start. But the Help Wanted label exists in several related projects:

- [IPFS ↗]()
- [libp2p ↗]()
- [IPLD ↗]()
- [Multiformats ↗]()

## Documentation

---

Filecoin is a huge project and undertaking, and with lots of code comes the need for lots of good documentation! However, we need a lot more help to write the awesome docs the project needs. If writing technical documentation is your area, we’d absolutely love your help!

Before contributing to the Filecoin docs, please read these quick guides; they'll save you time and help keep the docs accurate and consistent!

## Community

---

If interacting with people is your favorite thing to do in this world, join the [Ceramic chat and discussion forums]() to say hello, meet others who share your goals, and connect with other members of the community. 

If you're looking for something a bit more formal, we will soon be starting a [community ambassador program]() which you can apply to.
