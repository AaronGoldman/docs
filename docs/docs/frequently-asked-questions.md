### What are some of the primary use cases for Ceramic at launch?

Filecoin is a protocol that provides core primitives, enabling a truly trustless decentralized storage network. These primitives and features include publicly verifiable cryptographic storage proofs, [crypto-economic mechanisms 竊余(), and a public blockchain. Filecoin provides these primitives to solve the really hard problem of creating a trustless decentralized storage network.

On top of the core Filecoin protocol, there are a number of layer 2 solutions that enable a broad array of use cases and applications, many of which also use [IPFS 竊余(). These solutions include [Powergate 竊余(), [Textile Hub 竊余(), and more. Using these solutions, any use case that can be built on top of IPFS can also be built on Filecoin!

Some of the primary areas for development expected on Filecoin around mainnet launch are:

- Additional developer tools and layer-2 solutions and libraries that strengthen Filecoin as a developer platform and ecosystem.
- IPFS apps that rely on decentralized storage solutions and want a decentralized data persistence solution as well.
- Financial tools and services on Filecoin, like wallets, signing libraries, and more.
- Applications that use Filecoin's publicly verifiable cryptographic proofs in order to provide trustless and timestamped guarantees of storage to their users.
