# Introduction to stream programs

## What is a stream program?

---

A "stream program" is simply a program that runs on the Ceramic network. Its code is hosted by Ceramic nodes. This code is used when creating streams to define the logic, APIs, and state transition behavior. With this design, many different streams can be created by reusing stream programs.

Stream programs are a special type of data that lives on the Ceramic network. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.

## Limitations

---

Can't yet program your own, limited to the community-created standards.

Another limitation of stream programs is their storage. No single transaction can be larger than XXkb. A common way of circumnavigating this limitation is to break your transactions up into smaller transactions using the XXXXXX pattern.
