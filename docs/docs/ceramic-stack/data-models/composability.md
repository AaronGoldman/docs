# Composability

## A brief introduction

---

Smart contracts are public on Ethereum and can be thought of as open APIs. You don't need to write your own smart contract to become a dapp developer, you just need to know how to interact with them. For example, you can use the existing smart contracts of Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, to handle all the token swap logic in your app – you don't need to start from scratch. Check out some of their v2 and v3 contracts.
