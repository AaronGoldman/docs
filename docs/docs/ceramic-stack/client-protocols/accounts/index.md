# Ceramic accounts

Ceramic relies on the decentralized identifiers (DID) protocol for user accounts, which means there might be some new things to get familiar with. There are many benefits to using the DIDs protocol, namely interoperability of data and the flexibility of different access and authentication paterns. Also DIDs don't have to live on Ceramic to be Ceramic accounts. Any plain key pair can also be a DID, but so can NFTs and DAOs/Organizations. Also because Ceramic doesn't force it's own account system, you can use any key with Ceramic and reuse identities. But more, you can aggregate MACC.
