# **Legacy Tools**

This section contains various legacy Ceramic developer tools that are no longer actively maintained by the community. Without being maintained, we cannot recommend them. However, some applications are still using these tools and find the docs useful.

To build your application with the most current Ceramic developer tooling available, build with [ComposeDB: A Decentralized Graph Database for Web3 Apps](https://composedb.js.org).
