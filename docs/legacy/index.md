# **Legacy Ceramic Tools**
---

We recommend building your app with the most current developer tooling available. Build with [**ComposeDB: A Decentralized Graph Database for Web3 Apps â†’**](https://composedb.js.org).

This section contains docs for various legacy Ceramic developer tools that are no longer actively maintained. Some apps are still using these tools and need the docs, otherwise they would be deleted. The tools in this section make use of the IDX Database, a legacy and far less powerful DB alternative to ComposeDB.
