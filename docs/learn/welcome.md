### **Ceramic is a decentralized network for composable data.**

Ceramic makes building applications with composable Web3 data as easy as browsing a marketplace of data models, plugging them into your app, and storing, updating, and retrieving data from those models. When different applications reuse the same data models, their data is automatically interoperable. By decentralizing application databases, Ceramic makes data composable and reusable across all applications.

## **Build Applications**

### [**ComposeDB: Graph DB for Web3 Apps →**](https://composedb.js.org/)

ComposeDB is a decentralized graph database powered by Ceramic that enables you to build powerful Web3 applications using composable data, GraphQL, and reusable models.


## **Run a Ceramic node**

---

Provide storage, compute, and bandwidth to the network by running a node. Today there are no tokenized incentives for running a Ceramic node, but by running a node you can ensure the data for your app remains available while helping contribute to the network's decentralization.
