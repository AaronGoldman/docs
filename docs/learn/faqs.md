# FAQs

## **General**

### What is Ceramic?

Ceramic is a decentralized protocol for performing computation and state transitions for mutable streams of information stored on IPFS. Learn more about Ceramic in the [overview](overview.md).

### What is a stream?



### What should I use Ceramic for?

Many web3 projects use Ceramic as a flexible database replacement which enables their project to store mutable content in a way that is more secure, open, and user-controlled. Since Ceramic is a public, permissionless network, applications can also openly query, import, and build upon data created by any other third-party application. While there are many use cases for the capabilities provided by Ceramic, early adopters are using it for decentralized identity infrastructure (see [IDX](../tools/identity/idx.md)) and as way to manage user-generated and application-generated content that may evolve over time. For applications, Ceramic essentially provides powerful decentralized data legos to compliment the decentralized money legos already provided by public blockchain networks.

### What technologies is Ceramic built on?

Ceramic uses IPFS as a naming and routing layer and can be configured to use any storage network (such as Filecoin, Arweave, and others) for durable persistence. 

### How is Ceramic different from other Web3 storage solutions?

Compared to other mutable data solutions, Ceramic is designed to be maximally decentralized, flexible, and scalable. Ceramic enables developers to create their own stream types which essentially allows for the creation of any type of dynamic data structure on IPFS governed by its own set of computation, state transformation, and consensus logic.

### Does Ceramic have a token?

Ceramic does not currently have a token, however it is likely one will be introduced in the future as a payment mechanism for performing state transitions on streams and persisting the resulting StreamState to a durable, permissionless store such as a blockchain.

### Who is using Ceramic?

More than 200 projects are currently on the waiting list for the [Ceramic Mainnet Early Launch Program (ELP)](https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-mainnet-early-launch-program/). Sign up here to secure your spot. Many others are developing on the Ceramic testnet.

### Is Ceramic a blockchain?

### What does it cost to use Ceramic?


## **Operations**

### When is mainnet launching?

Public mainnet is scheduled for early Q3 2021. Projects wishing to deploy to mainnet earlier than that are welcome to apply to the Early Launch Program, which is going live in May 2021, that provides a controlled mainnet environment to a select group of projects. 

### Who is building the project?

Ceramic is an open source, community-driven project. It was invented by 3Box Labs, who continue to serve as core contributors to the network but possess no special permissions compared to any other contributors.

### Who are the investors?
