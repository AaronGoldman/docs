# Use Cases

Explore the many ways your project or business can leverage Ceramic's data streaming platform. Streams can be used to create evolutionary files or as peer-to-peer databases, which have a range of applications across Web3 and enterprise applications.

### Decentralized identity
Build apps with interoperable, user-controlled data storage. IDX, Ceramic's identity system, supports DIDs for cross-chain IDs, streams for storage, and hubs for linking streams to a user. Identities are based on W3C standards and can be used with wallets from many different blockchains and Web3 platforms.

Features
- Cross-chain identity and reputation
- Multi-app user profiles and other identity metadata
- User-controlled data storage
