# Use Cases

Explore the many ways your project or business can leverage Ceramic's data streaming platform. Ceramic is a general-purpose protocol, so this list is definitely non-exhaustive. It's only meant to serve as a starting point for ideation.

### **Decentralized identity**
A robust, flexible, and standards-based decentralized identity system is the cornerstone of any application built with Web3 data. Build apps with interoperable, user-controlled data storage. IDX, Ceramic's identity system, supports DIDs for cross-chain IDs, streams for storage, and hubs for linking streams to a user. Identities are based on W3C standards and can be used with wallets from many different blockchains and Web3 platforms.

- Cross-chain identifiers
- Reputation systems
- Multi-app user profiles
- User-controlled storage
- Portable social graphs

### **Decentralized databases**
Replace your backend and store/host all of your user data or application data in streams to eliminate centralized database servers, blockchains, or local storage. 

- user-generated content
- user activity and history
- application data and state
- Decentralized, cross-device, user-controlled local storage

### **Evolutionary files**
Store editable, version-controlled documents, files, and media on IPFS that maintain a transparent and auditable history without needing to keep track of changing [CIDs](./glossary.md#cid).

- Mutable NFT storage
- JSON document storage
- Metadata
- Verifiable credentials
- Public, mutable JSON schemas (i.e. you could decentralized schema.org)

### **Multi-user applications and community platforms**

- Decentralized social media
- Community and governance forums
- Portable, user-controlled social graphs

### **Decentralized publications**

- Blogging platforms
- News media and publications

### **Cross-application data sharing**
On Ceramic, all data is published to the open web where it's easy to share streams between different organizations and applications without centralized servers or APIs, link multiple streams together to form a graph of relationships.


- Multi-organizational data
- Enterprise system of record (SOR)

### **Remixable content**
Fork and remix existing streams into entirely new creations.
