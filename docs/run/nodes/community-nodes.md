!!! warning

    These nodes are only meant to help you get started. You **should not** rely on them for long-term data availability or production usage. The storage for these nodes will be periodically wiped. If your streams have not been replicated by another node when this happens they will be lost. If you need long-term data persistence or production usage, consider [running your own node](./nodes.md).

### Node Hosting Providers

We are working with various third-party services to offer commercial-grade hosted Ceramic nodes for developers. This is in-process for early 2022. If you're interested in being among the first to offer hosted Ceramic nodes as a service, reach out on the [Ceramic Community Discord]().
