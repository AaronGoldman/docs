# Graphite: Switch Networks

This guide will show you how to switch between various Ceramic networks with Graphite, depending on your testing or development needs.

As we mentioned in the [installation guide](), Graphite is compiled to operate on a single network, and the information in the configuration folder corresponds to that network.

There are currently three Ceramic networks: `mainnet`, `testnet-clay`, and `dev-unstable`. Learn more about each network here: [https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/)

- Local devnet - You can run a [local devnet]() (opens new window)
- Testnets
  - [Clay]()
- [Mainnet]()

> Choose one of the following methods to switch to a different network.

## Default network

---

By default, the JS CLI starts a node on the [Clay Testnet](../../learn/networks.md#clay-testnet). If you would like to use a different network, you can specify this using the `--network` option. View [available networks](../../learn/networks.md). Note, the CLI can not yet be used with [Mainnet](../../learn/networks.md#mainnet).
