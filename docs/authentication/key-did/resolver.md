# Key DID Resolver
The Key DID Resolver is a [DID resolver](../../learn/glossary.md#did-resolver) for the [Key DID Method](./method.md). When using the Key DID Method for [authentication](../../build/authentication.md) in your Ceramic project, the Key DID Resolver must be imported during [installation](../../build/installation.md).

## Usage
Follow the [installation](../../build/installation.md) guide for how to import the Key DID Resolver into your project.

## Resources
You can find the source code for the JavaScript implementation of the Key DID Resolver at [`ceramicnetwork/key-did-resolver`](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/tree/develop/packages/key-did-resolver){:target="_blank"}. It works as a plugin to the core [`decentralized-identity/did-resolver`](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver){:target="_blank"} package maintained by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).
