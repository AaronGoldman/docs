# 3ID Connect

3ID Connect is the most widely used [authentication]() provider for Ceramic. The 3ID Connect authentication SDK allows users to use a [3ID DID]() with their existing blockchain wallet(s). 3ID Connect was designed for developers building Ceramic-enabled web apps whose users already have a blockchain/crypto wallet. By using 3ID Connect, your users get to rely on the signing and key management capabilities of the crypto wallet(s) they already have instead of needing to install a separate wallet.

**Want to install 3ID Connect?** Visit the [**usage**](#usage) section below.

**Want to try 3ID Connect?** Visit [Self.ID](https://self.id) to try it in a live application.

> 3ID Connect is not a substitute for a crypto wallet. It works alongside these wallets.

#### Supported blockchains

- Ethereum
- EVM compatible L1s and L2s (i.e. Avalanche, Moonbeam)
- NEAR (coming soon)
- EOS (coming soon)
- Cosmos (coming soon)
- Polkadot (coming soon)

## **Benefits**

### For users

- **Nothing to install**: Users don't need to install 3ID Connect. They only need a blockchain wallet.
- **Same identity across accounts**: Users can use the same DID across many different blockchain accounts.
- **Same identity across chains**: Users can use the same DID across all L1 and L2 blockchain platforms.
- **No additional key management**: Users don't need to manage the private key for their DID â€“ just their existing blockchain wallet.
- **Automatic 3Box profile migration**:

### For developers

- **Easy to install**: See usage section below to add 3ID Connect to your project.
- **3ID provider**: Access all methods in the 3ID DID provider.
- **Better user experience**: User-friendly design makes it seamless for your users to use DIDs.
- **Works with web apps**: Written in JavaScript/TypeScript and hosted in an iFrame.

## **Usage**

Before installing 3ID Connect, you must have [installed a Ceramic client](installation.md) and [configured a DID](configure-did.md) for that client. By following the steps below, your users will be able to [perform writes]() on Ceramic using a [3ID DID]() from their blockchain wallet.


### 1. Installation

```
npm install @3id/connect
```

### 2. Import the provider

```
import { ThreeIdConnect,  <BlockchainAuthProvider> } from '@3id/connect'
```

    ??? warning "Understanding `BlockchainAuthProvider`"
    The `BlockchainAuthProvider` parameter is always required but the name shown here is just a placeholder. In your application, you should substitute in the specific BlockchainAuthProvider you are using. A full list of supported BlockchainAuthProviders can be found [here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils/tree/master/src/blockchains).

Example using an Ethereum wallet:

```
import { ThreeIdConnect,  EthereumAuthProvider } from '@3id/connect'
```

### 3. Request user's address

```
const addresses = await <blockchainName>.enable()
```

Example using an Ethereum wallet:

```
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
```

### 4. Request authentication

```
const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
const authProvider = new <BlockchainAuthProvider>(<blockchainName>, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)
```

Example using an Ethereum wallet:

```
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)
```
  
  
      !!! warning ""
    This will prompt the user with a 3ID Connect permissions window.
  
  
### 5. Create provider instance

```
const provider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
```

### 6. Set the provider
Set the Provider instance to the DID instance used by your Ceramic client in order to perform writes.

```
ceramic.did.setProvider(provider)
```

### 7. Authenticate the DID

```
await ceramic.did.authenticate()
```

      !!! warning ""
    This will prompt the user with a 3ID Connect permissions window.
    
Your users will now be authenticated and can perform writes to streams on Ceramic.
