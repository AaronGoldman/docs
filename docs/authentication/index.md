# Decentralized Identities
Ceramic has the most flexible decentralized identity and user account system in the world. Ceramic uses an account system based on DIDs and supports multi-account, cross-chain (MACC), a necessity in the dataverse to allow Alice to keep a unified identity control over her data even if she dabbles with a few different blockchain ecosystems.
